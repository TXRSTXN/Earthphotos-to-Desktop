# Earthphotos-to-Desktop
Gets the top photo from Reddit's /r/earthporn and sets it as the OS X desktop background.
On my machines, this is set as a cron job for each morning.

Note:
In System Preferences, navigate to Keyboard, then Shortcuts. Choose Mission Control.
Ensure that the "Switch to Desktop #" checkboxes are all turned on.
Otherwise, only one desktop will get set.

Layout of the 'sensitive.txt' file, line by line:
  1   client id
  2   client secret
  3   username
  4   password
  5   app name
